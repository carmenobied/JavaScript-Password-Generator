# JavaScript: Password Generator

The goal was to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the JavaScript code. This also involved ensuring the app features a clean and polished UI, with a responsive layout, ensuring it adapts to multiple screen sizes. Employees with access to sensitive data will often need to be able to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so that they can create a strong password that provides greater security.

## Installation
```bash
i. Fork the Github repository.
ii. Clone the forked repo into your local machine using gitbash/terminal to pull the project and data.
iii. Access the index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html files and assets via Visual Studio or in your browser to view the code and website respectively.  
iv. Check the site on different devices and screens to see the responsiveness.
```

## Usage
JavaScript Components Used:
```bash
function() - generatePassword() - Math.random() - Math.floor() - charAt() method - .toString() method - document.getElementByID()
```
